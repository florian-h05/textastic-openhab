# Syntax Highlighting for openHAB Configuration Files

### Credits and huge thanks go to [@reitermarkus](https://github.com/reitermarkus) for his work on [reitermarkus/OpenHAB.tmbundle](https://github.com/reitermarkus/OpenHAB.tmbundle).

I only updated ```Makefile``` with a corrected link to the Syntax definition from [openhab/openhab-vscode](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-vscode) as the required file has been deleted long time ago.
It is now only accessible in the git history.
